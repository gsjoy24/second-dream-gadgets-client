## Instructions on how to run the application locally üìù

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository to your machine if you have the access. Use this link to do it.
  ‚Ü¶ <https://github.com/Porgramming-Hero-web-course/l2-b2-assignment-6-fronten-gsjoy24.git>
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the project in vs code and create a file named .env.local in the root of the folder.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add the code bellow in the .env.local file

```
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://second-dream-server.vercel.app/api/
VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=41d6a469676573f180207dfc96d6c804
```

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Open the command prompt on the project path or terminal on the vs code by pressing Ctrl + `
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the command 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install all the necessary dependencies.
- 6Ô∏è‚É£ To run the application on <http://localhost:5173>, run the command 'npm run dev'. if the application is running, you will see the login page on the localhost.

- 7Ô∏è‚É£ use the credentials to login

```
<!-- for admin -->
email :superAdmin@gmail.com
password : superAdmin0

<!-- for manager -->
email : manager@gmail.com
password : ManagerPr0

<!-- for user -->
email :user@gmail.com
password : UserPr00
```

Now you can do all the CRUD operations that was required for the assignment. I will recommend you to see the package.json file to see all the commands.
